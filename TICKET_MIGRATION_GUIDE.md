# Housie Ticket Migration Guide

This guide explains how to fix existing tickets that don't follow proper Housie rules and migrate them to the correct 3√ó9 grid format.

## Overview

The ticket migration system identifies and fixes tickets that were created with the old algorithm and don't meet proper Housie standards:

### Proper Housie Rules
- **3 rows √ó 9 columns** (27 cells total)
- **Exactly 5 numbers per row** (15 numbers total, 12 empty cells)
- **Column ranges**: 1-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-90
- **Maximum 3 numbers per column**
- **No duplicate numbers** within a ticket

## How to Use Migration

### 1. Access Admin Panel
- Log in as admin
- Go to **Settings** tab in the admin panel
- You'll see the **"Ticket Migration & Validation"** section

### 2. Analyze Existing Tickets
1. Click **"Analyze Tickets"** button
2. The system will check all existing tickets against Housie rules
3. View results showing:
   - Total tickets in database
   - Number of valid tickets
   - Number of invalid tickets (with specific issues)

### 3. Fix Invalid Tickets

#### Option A: Dry Run (Recommended First)
1. Click **"Dry Run Fix"** to simulate the migration
2. Review what changes would be made
3. No actual changes are applied to the database

#### Option B: Live Fix
1. Click **"Fix Invalid Tickets"** to apply actual changes
2. Invalid tickets will be regenerated with proper Housie format
3. Game and user associations are preserved
4. Only the ticket numbers are updated

#### Option C: Full Migration
1. Click **"Run Full Migration"** for complete automated process
2. Analyzes and fixes all issues in one operation

### 4. Review Results
- See detailed statistics of processed/fixed/failed tickets
- View any errors that occurred during migration
- Refresh analysis to confirm all tickets are now valid

## What Gets Fixed

### Common Issues Detected:
- ‚ùå Wrong number of numbers (not exactly 15)
- ‚ùå Duplicate numbers within a ticket
- ‚ùå Numbers outside valid range (1-90)
- ‚ùå More than 3 numbers in any column
- ‚ùå Incorrect column distributions

### What Stays the Same:
- ‚úÖ Game ID and associations
- ‚úÖ User ID and ownership
- ‚úÖ Purchase timestamp
- ‚úÖ Claimed prizes history

### What Gets Updated:
- üîÑ Ticket numbers (regenerated with proper format)
- üîÑ Last updated timestamp

## Safety Features

### Built-in Protections:
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test changes before applying
- **Validation**: All new tickets are validated before saving
- **Error Handling**: Failed updates don't affect other tickets
- **Rollback Safe**: Original associations preserved

### Edge Function Support:
- Uses Supabase edge functions when available for better performance
- Automatic fallback to client-side processing if needed
- Progress tracking and detailed logging

## Technical Details

### Validation Rules:
```typescript
‚úÖ Exactly 15 unique numbers (1-90)
‚úÖ 3 rows √ó 9 columns layout
‚úÖ Exactly 5 numbers per row
‚úÖ Maximum 3 numbers per column
‚úÖ Correct column ranges:
   Col 1: 1-9    Col 6: 50-59
   Col 2: 10-19  Col 7: 60-69
   Col 3: 20-29  Col 8: 70-79
   Col 4: 30-39  Col 9: 80-90
   Col 5: 40-49
```

### Performance:
- Processes tickets in batches to avoid database overload
- Progress tracking for large migrations
- Optimized queries to minimize database load

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails:
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify admin permissions
3. Try smaller batches (dry run first)
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages

### If Some Tickets Can't Be Fixed:
- Review error messages in the results
- Check for database constraints
- Manually verify problematic ticket data

### If Edge Function is Unavailable:
- System automatically falls back to client-side processing
- May be slower for large numbers of tickets
- All functionality remains available

## Best Practices

1. **Always run analysis first** to understand the scope
2. **Use dry run mode** before applying real changes
3. **Backup your database** before major migrations (recommended)
4. **Run migration during low-traffic periods** for better performance
5. **Verify results** by analyzing tickets after migration

## Example Migration Flow

```bash
1. Analyze Tickets ‚Üí "Found 45 invalid tickets"
2. Dry Run Fix ‚Üí "Would fix 45 tickets successfully"  
3. Fix Invalid Tickets ‚Üí "Fixed 45 out of 45 tickets"
4. Analyze Again ‚Üí "All 150 tickets are now valid!"
```

## Support

If you encounter issues with ticket migration:
1. Check the error messages in the admin panel
2. Review browser developer console for detailed logs
3. Verify database permissions and connectivity
4. Contact system administrator if problems persist

**Note**: This migration only needs to be run once after upgrading to the new Housie ticket algorithm. All new tickets will automatically follow proper Housie rules.
